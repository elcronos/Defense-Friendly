Code and data related WACV 2021 paper: "Defense-friendly Images in Adversarial Attacks: Dataset and Metrics for Perturbation Difficulty" [Paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/papers/Pestana_Defense-Friendly_Images_in_Adversarial_Attacks_Dataset_and_Metrics_for_Perturbation_WACV_2021_paper.pdf)

### Dataset
The dataset contains 3 CSV files with information about the ɛ-robustness levels of the images in the dataset.
Easy Images, ɛ-robust and Defense-friendly are terms relative to the attacks and defenses used. However, we provide the ɛ-robustness information of each image in this dataset according to our experiments as a reference.

The dataset is available in the link below:
